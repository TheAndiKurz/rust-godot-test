# Rust Godot Binding Test Project

This project is here to test how the bindings between rust and godot work using [gdext](https://github.com/godot-rust/gdext).

Also this project is to see how smooth the working between rust and godot is.

## Setup

For the setup first follow the steps [here](https://godot-rust.github.io/book/intro/setup.html).

If you are done with that you can go into the rust directory and run:
```
cargo build
```

Then run godot and select the `godot/project.godot` file to open the project.

You can now run the game and it should show you a rotating city with shadows.
